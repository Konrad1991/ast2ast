FunctionRegistry:
- maybe add a remove function in order to remove elements from vectors and matrices
- add missing flattening of types. Check at least by writing tests.

Tests:
- Write tests. for every error which can be thrown.

Documentation:
- document that integers have to be defined using L. Otherwise they are emitted as doubles except in subsetting, colon and printing
- cannot assign to iterator
