Description: Enable translation of a tiny subset of R to C++. The user has to define a R function which gets translated. For a full list of possible functions check the documentation. After translation an R function is returned which is a shallow wrapper around the C++ code. Alternatively an external pointer to the C++ function is returned to the user. The intention of the package is to generate fast functions which can be used as ode-system or during optimization.
