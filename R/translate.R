#' Translates an R function into a C++ function. 
#' 
#' An R function is translated to C++ soruce code and afterwards compiled. \cr
#'     The result can be an external pointer (XPtr) or an R function. \cr 
#'     The default value is an R function. \cr
#'     Further information can be found in the vignette: 'Detailed Documentation'. \cr
#' @param f The function which should be translated from R to C++.
#' @param verbose If set to TRUE the output of RcppXPtrUtils::cppXPtr or Rcpp::cppFunction is printed.
#' @param reference If set to TRUE the arguments are passed by reference (not possible if output should be an R function)..
#' @param output If set to "R" an R function wrapping the C++ code is returned. \cr
#'               If output is set to "XPtr" an external pointer object pointing to the C++ code is returned. \cr
#'               The default value is "R". 
#'                \strong{However, the performance of the R function is currently suboptimal}.
#' @return The external pointer of the generated C++ function or an R function is created. 
#' @details \strong{The following types are supported: }
#'  \enumerate{
#'    \item numeric vectors
#'    \item numeric matrices
#'  }
#'  Variables can be either numeric vectors or matrices.
#'  Notably, it is possible that the variables change the type within the function. \cr
#'  \strong{It is possible to declare a variable of a scalar numeric data type.
#'          This is done by adding '_db' to the end of the variable. Each time '_db' is found
#'          the variable is declared as a scalar numeric data type. In this case the
#'          object cannot change its type!}
#' @details \strong{The following functions are supported:}
#'  \enumerate{
#'    \item assignment: = and <-
#'    \item allocation: vector and matrix
#'    \item information about objects: length and dim
#'    \item Basic operations: +, -, *, /
#'    \item Indices: [] and at
#'    \item mathematical functions: sin, asin, sinh, cos, acos, cosh, tan, atan, tanh, sqrt, log, ^ and exp
#'    \item concatenate objects: c
#'    \item control flow: for, if, else if, else
#'    \item comparison: ==, !=, >, <, >= and <=
#'    \item printing: print
#'    \item returning objects: return
#'    \item catmull-rome spline: cmr
#'    \item to get a range of numbers the ':' function can be used
#'  }
#' @details  \strong{Some details about the implemented functions}
#' @details  \itemize{
#'    \item allocation of memory works: Following forms are possible: vector(size_of_elements), vector(value, size_of_elements), 
#'              matrix(nrows, ncols), matrix(value, nrows, ncols) and matrix(vector, nrows, ncols). The latter fills the matrix or the vector with the specified 'value'. \cr
#'    \item For indices squared brackets '[]' can be used as common in R. Beyond that the function 'at' exists
#'              which accepts as first argument a variable and as the second argument you pass the desired index.
#'              The caveat of using 'at' is that only one entry can be accessed. The function '[]' can return more then one element. \cr
#'              \strong{The 'at'function returns a reference to the vector entry.
#'                Therefore variable[index] can behave differently then at(variable, index).
#'                The function has to be used carefully when 'at' is used.
#'                Especially if '[]' and 'at' are mixed the function behaviour is difficult to predict.
#'                Please test it before using it in a serious project.}  \cr
#'    \item For-loops can be written as common in R
#'            \itemize{
#'                \item Nr.1 \cr
#'                      for(index in variable)\{ \cr
#'                        # do whatever \cr
#'                      \} \cr
#'                \item Nr.2 \cr
#'                      for(index in 1:length(variable)\{ \cr
#'                        # do whatever \cr
#'                      \} \cr
#'    }
#'    \item Be aware that it is not possible to assign the result of a comparison to a variable.
#'    \item The print function accepts either a scalar, vector, matrix, string, bool or nothing (empty line).
#'    \item In order to return an object use the 'return' function (The last object is not returned automatically as in R).
#'    \item In order to interpolate values the 'cmr' function can be used. The function needs three arguments.
#'          \enumerate{
#'            \item the first argument is the point of the independent variable (x) for which the dependent variable should be calculated (y). This has to be a vector of length one.
#'            \item the second argument is a vector defining the points of the independent variable (x). This has to be a vector of at least length four.
#'            \item the third argument is a vector defining the points of the dependent variable (y). This has to be a vector of at least length four.
#'        }
#'  } \cr
#' \strong{Be aware that the R code is translated to ETR an expression template library which tries to mimic R. \cr
#' However, it does not behave exactly like R! Please check your compiled function before using it in a serious project.
