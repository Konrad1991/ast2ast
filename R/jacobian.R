#' Calculates the jacobian function and translatesthe resulting function into a C++ function.

#' @aliases J
#' 
#' @description
#' An R function is translated to C++ source code and afterwards the code is compiled. \
#' The result can be an external pointer (\emph{XPtr}) or an \emph{R} function. \
#' The default value is an R function.
#' Further information can be found in the vignette: \emph{Detailed Documentation}. \
#' 
#' 
#' @details
#' \strong{The types \emph{numeric vector} and \emph{numeric matrix} are supported.
#' Notably, it is possible that the variables change the type within the function. }\cr
#' \strong{Beyond that, be aware that the passed \emph{SEXP} objects are only copied if the size increases. Thus, R objects can be modified within the function! \cr
#'   For example in the following code the variable \emph{a} contains \emph{1, 2, and 3} before the function call and afterwards \emph{1, 1 and 1}.
#'   In contrast for variable \emph{b} the size changes and thus the object within \emph{R} is not modified. Furthermore, the variable \emph{c} is not increased and only the first element is         changed.} \cr
#' \verb{
#'   f <- function(a, b, c) { 
#'     a[c(1, 2, 3)] <- 1 
#'     b <- vector(10) 
#'     c <- vector(1)
#'   } 
#'   fcpp <- ast2ast::translate(f) 
#'   a <- c(1, 2, 3) 
#'   b <- c(1, 2, 3) 
#'   c <- c(1, 2, 3)
#'   fcpp(a, b,c) 
#'   print(a) 
#'   print(b) 
#'   print(c)
#' }
#' \strong{It is possible to declare a variable of a scalar numeric data type.
#'   This is done by adding \emph{_db} to the end of the variable. Each time \emph{_db} is found
#'   the variable is declared as a scalar numeric data type. In this case the
#'   object cannot change its type! In the example below the variable \emph{a_db} is of type double whereas \emph{b} is of type "sexp".} \cr
#' \verb{
#'   f <- function() {
#'     a_db = 3.14
#'     b = 3.14
#'   }
#'   fcpp <- ast2ast::translate(f, verbose = TRUE)
#'   fcpp()
#' } \cr
#' In R every object is under the hood a \emph{SEXP} object.
#' In case an \emph{R} function is created as output only \emph{SEXP} elements can be passed to the function. 
#' Furthermore, these functions always return a \emph{SEXP} element. Even if nothing is returned; in this case \emph{NULL} is returned!. 
#' Notably, is that only numeric vectors (in R also scalar values are vectors) or numeric matrices can be passed to the function. \cr
#' In contrast if an external pointer is created other types can be specified which are passed to the function or returned from it. 
#' The default value is a variable of type \emph{sexp}. This is the data type which is used in the C++ code. 
#' The \emph{ptr_vec} and \emph{ptr_mat} interface work in a different way. If using \emph{ptr_vec} a \emph{double*} pointer is expected as first element.
#' Additionally a second argument is needed which is of type \emph{int} and which defines the size of the array. 
#' This works in the same way for \emph{ptr_mat}. But instead of the size argument two integers are needed which define the number of rows and columns.
#' Both arguments have to be of type \emph{int}. 
#' Notably, the memory is only borrowed. Thus, the memory is not automatically deleted! See vignette \emph{InformationForPackageAuthors} for more information. \cr
#' \strong{The following functions are supported:}
#' \enumerate{
#'   \item assignment: = and <-
#'     \item allocation: vector and matrix
#'   \item information about objects: length and dim
#'   \item Basic operations: +, -, *, /
#'     \item Indices: \emph{'[]'}. \strong{The function 'at' cannot be used! Beyond that only integer values are allowed within the brackets.}
#'   \item mathematical functions: sin, asin, sinh, cos, acos, cosh, tan, atan, tanh, sqrt, log, ^ and exp
#'   \item concatenate objects: c
#'   \item control flow: for, if, else if, else
#'     \item comparison: ==, !=, >, <, >= and <=
#'     \item printing: print
#'   \item returning objects: return
#'   \item catmull-rome spline: cmr
#'   \item to get a range of numbers the ':' function can be used
#'   \item is.na and is.infinite can be used to test for NA and Inf.

#' 
#' @param f The function which should be translated from R to C++. 
#'
#' @param y The variables to compute the derivatives of (the dependent variable). For example: df/dx
#' 
#' @param x The variables to which respect the variables are calcualted (the independent variable). For example: df/dx
#' 
#' @param output If set to "R"" an R function wrapping the C++ code is returned. \cr
#' If output is set to "XPtr"" an external pointer object pointing to the C++ code is returned. \cr
#' The default value is "R".
#' 
#' @param types_of_args define the types of the arguments passed to the function as an character vector. 
#' This is an optional input if using "XPtr" as output. \cr
#' The default value is "SEXP" as this is the only possibility for output "R". \cr
#' In case one want to use an external pointer the easiest way is to pass "sexp" for types_of_args. \cr
#' Beyond that it is possible to pass "double", "ptr_vec" and "ptr_mat".
#' For more information see below for details and check the vignette \emph{InformationForPackageAuthors}.
#' \strong{Beyond that, be aware that the passed \emph{SEXP} objects are only copied if the object size increases.
#'   Thus, R objects can be modified within the function! See in section details for an example} \cr
#'     
#' @param return_type is a character defining the type which the function returns. The default value is "SEXP"" as this is the only possibility for output "R".
#' 
#' @param reference If set to TRUE the arguments are passed by reference (not possible if output is "R").
#' 
#' @param verbose If set to TRUE the output of the compilation process is printed.
#' 
#' @param getsource If set to TRUE the function is not compiled and instead the C++ source code itself is returned.
#' 
#' @return 
#' If output is set to \emph{R} an R function is returned. Thus, the C++ code can directly be called within R. \
#' In contrast a function which returns an external pointer is generated if the output is set to \emph{XPtr}.
